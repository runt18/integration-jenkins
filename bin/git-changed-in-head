# Some explanations for the git command below:
# HEAD^ will not exist for an initial commit, we thus need `git show`
# --name-only : strip the patch payload, only report the file being altered
# --diff-filter=ACM : only care about files Added, Copied or Modified
# -m : show differences for merge commits ...
# --first-parent : ... but only follow the first parent commit
# --format=format: : strip out the commit summary
#
# Then we pass the wildcard generated above
# And finally we need to strip out the empty line generated by format:
git show HEAD \
	--name-only \
	--diff-filter=ACM \
	-m \
	--first-parent \
	--format=format: \
	-- "${PATH_ARGS[@]}" | egrep -v '^$' || :  # grep exit 1 when nothing is found
